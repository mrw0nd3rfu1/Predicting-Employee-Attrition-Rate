# Predicting-Employee-Attrition-Rate
Using Regression for predicting of Attrition Rate of Employees.

In this problem I used normal label encoding to encode several fields of data for converting categorical data into numbers for machine to process.

Then using LinearRegression I found that the results matched best and most accurate prediction was possible.
Using this model I got 82% accuracy.

RandomForest didn't yield best result for this model as the accuracy decreased when using it.
